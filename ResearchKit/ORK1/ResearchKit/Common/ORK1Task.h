/**
 The `ORK1Task` protocol defines a task to be carried out by a participant
 in a research study. To present the ResearchKit framework UI in your app, instantiate an
 object that implements the `ORK1Task` protocol (such as `ORK1OrderedTask`) and
 provide it to an `ORK1TaskViewController` object.
 
 Implement this protocol to enable dynamic selection of the steps for a given task.
 By default, `ORK1OrderedTask` implements this protocol for simple sequential tasks.
 
 Each step (`ORK1Step`) in a task roughly corresponds to one screen, and represents the
 primary unit of work in any task presented by a task view controller. For example,
 an `ORK1QuestionStep` object corresponds to a single question presented on screen,
 together with controls the participant uses to answer the question. Another example is `ORK1FormStep`, which corresponds to a single
 screen that displays multiple questions or items for which participants provide information, such as first name, last name, and birth date.
 
 Each step corresponds to one
 `ORK1StepViewController` object, which may manage child view controllers in a particular
 sequence. The correspondence of step to view controller holds even though some steps, such as `ORK1VisualConsentStep` and
 `ORK1ConsentReviewStep`, can produce multiple screens.
